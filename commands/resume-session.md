# Resume Previous Session

Use the `context-resume` skill to restore a previously saved work session.

This command will:
1. List all available saved sessions from `docs/context-sessions/`
2. Allow you to select which session to resume
3. Load the context including pending tasks and key files
4. Continue work from where you left off

After selecting a session, Claude will help you continue with the remaining tasks.
